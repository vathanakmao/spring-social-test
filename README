Spring Social Test

>>>>>>> Facebook login using the signed_request param (no spring social

This is just a simple Facebook application for showing the currently logged-in user's details in the Facebook Canvas page.

+ To access the app on Facebook, type https://apps.facebook.com/mytestapp-truefalse/ and you will see the currently logged-in user's details such as username, email, etc.
+ App settings URL:

+ Workflow
    Users needs to authorize the app first before they can access the application.
    FBAuthorizationInterceptor redirects a user to the Login Dialog (grant-permissions page) if he/she hasn't authorized the app yet.
    If the user accepts the Login Dialog, he/she is redirected back to the URL they tried to open with the signed_request parameter.
    The signed_request parameter is a decoded string contained user_id, access_token, etc. The access token is used to make API calls to Facebook for example, post a message to the user's wall.
    The parameters are mapped to FbSignedRequest object and stored in session. If the object exists in session, we don't need to redirect the user the Login Dialog.
    There is an API to clear session "/admin/session/clear".
